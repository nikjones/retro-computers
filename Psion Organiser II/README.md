# Psion Organiser II
# History
The Organiser II was first introduced in 1986, featuring a 2-line display. The CM model came with 8K of RAM, while the XP model was equipped with 16K. Shortly after, the XP was upgraded to 32K RAM, although it retained the XP label on its casing; this version is often referred to as the LA model. All these models included a 32K ROM.

Most Organisers were produced with English menus and error messages. However, versions in other languages, such as French and German, were also manufactured. Eventually, a multi-lingual XP model was released, offering a choice of 11 languages. Its ROM capacity was increased to 64K, using two additional 16K banks to store the extra language data.

In 1989, Psion introduced models with a 4-line display. The LZ model featured 32K of RAM, while the LZ64 model offered 64K (32K plus two 16K RAM banks). Although visually similar to earlier models, the newer versions had a slightly taller screen. These models were all multi-lingual, typically offering English alongside French and German. A Scandinavian version included English, Swedish, and Danish language options.
